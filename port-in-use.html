<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that there are no other instances of OpenRecV2 running. Check your running processes or services and terminate any existing instances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have any other programs or services utilizing the same port, consider shutting them down
3.reconfiguring their settings to use a different port.
Alternatively, you can modify the port used by OpenRecV2 in its configuration files. Look for the port setting and change it to an available port that is not being used by any other application.
After applying these steps, restart OpenRecV2 and try accessing it again via <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>.
